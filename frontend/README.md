# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

#App.jsx - Routing
The App.jsx component serves as the entry point for your React application. It plays a crucial role in handling routing by using the "Routes" mechanism to navigate between different pages within the application. Each of the application's pages is returned and routed from this component.

#Lessons.jsx - Topics and Lessons Display
The Lessons.jsx component is responsible for displaying lessons and topics within your application. It uses Material UI accordion components to create a user-friendly interface. This component accepts an array of topics as a parameter. Each topic contains the name of the topic and an array of lessons related to it. Lessons are composed of a name, description, and a unique identifier (id). The Lessons.jsx component iterates through the array, organizing topics and lessons within accordions.

#LessonList.jsx - List of Lessons
The LessonList.jsx component is used to generate a list of lessons, turning each lesson in the passed lessons array into a card using the LessonCard function. This component is designed to be used within the Lessons.jsx component, allowing lessons to be presented as cards within an accordion.
